# ICA-SignalSeparation
MATLAB implementation of signal separation on mixed images using fast ICA

The original images are Recording-1.png and Recording-2.png. The MATLAB script takes these images, performs fast ICA, and 
separates the noise from the image of neurons, resulting in s1.png and s2.png.
